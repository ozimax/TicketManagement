In modern C#, especially in frameworks that use constructor injection (like ASP.NET Core), 
it's common to pass dependencies directly to the constructor without manually assigning them to class fields 
(i.e., you don't need the this. initialization explicitly). 

The constructor parameters are automatically used as local variables in the methods (like Handle in your case), 
and they're implicitly assigned to instance fields, which is handled by the framework.

This behavior relies on implicit constructor injection â€” the dependencies are passed into the class constructor by the DI container, 
and the container knows which instance to inject when creating the object.



#########Example:



namespace TicketManagement.Application.Features.TicketRequest.Queries.GetTicketRequestList;

public class GetTicketRequestListQueryHandler(

    ITicketRequestRepository ticketRequestRepository,
    IMapper mapper,
    IUserService userService)
    : IRequestHandler<GetTicketRequestListQuery, List<TicketRequestListDto>>
{
    public async Task<List<TicketRequestListDto>> Handle(GetTicketRequestListQuery request,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        List<Domain.TicketRequest> ticketRequests;
        List<TicketRequestListDto> requests;

        if (request.IsLoggedInUser)
        {
            var userId = userService.UserId;
            ticketRequests = await ticketRequestRepository.GetTicketWithDetails(userId);
            requests = mapper.Map<List<TicketRequestListDto>>(ticketRequests);
	    //etc

        }
        else
        {
            ticketRequests = await ticketRequestRepository.GetTicketWithDetails();
	    //etc
        }

        return requests;
    }
}
