In a .NET project, the Commands and Queries folders typically represent the Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern. 
This pattern is used to separate commands (which modify state) from queries (which retrieve data) to improve the scalability, 
maintainability, and performance of an application. The main idea behind CQRS is to have a clear distinction between operations 
that change the state of the application (commands) and those that only read data (queries).

Overview of CQRS
In the CQRS pattern:

Commands are used for write operations (e.g., creating, updating, deleting data).

Queries are used for read operations (e.g., retrieving data without changing the state of the system).

By segregating these responsibilities, CQRS allows each type of operation to be optimized and handled independently. 
This pattern is particularly useful in complex applications, 
especially when scaling or optimizing the performance of either the read or write side of the application.


// Command to create a new user
public class CreateUserCommand
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; }
    public DateTime DateOfBirth { get; set; }
}

// Command Handler for CreateUserCommand
public class CreateUserCommandHandler
{
    private readonly IUserRepository _userRepository;

    public CreateUserCommandHandler(IUserRepository userRepository)
    {
        _userRepository = userRepository;
    }

    public async Task<ValidationResult> Handle(CreateUserCommand command)
    {
        // Perform business logic and validation
        var user = new User(command.Name, command.Email, command.DateOfBirth);
        
        // Save the user to the database (state change)
        await _userRepository.AddUserAsync(user);

        return ValidationResult.Success; // Success acknowledgment
    }
}




// Query to get a user by ID
public class GetUserByIdQuery
{
    public int UserId { get; set; }
}

// Query Handler for GetUserByIdQuery
public class GetUserByIdQueryHandler
{
    private readonly IUserRepository _userRepository;

    public GetUserByIdQueryHandler(IUserRepository userRepository)
    {
        _userRepository = userRepository;
    }

    public async Task<UserDTO> Handle(GetUserByIdQuery query)
    {
        var user = await _userRepository.GetUserByIdAsync(query.UserId);
        
        if (user == null)
        {
            return null; // No user found
        }

        // Return user data in a DTO format
        return new UserDTO
        {
            Id = user.Id,
            Name = user.Name,
            Email = user.Email
        };
    }
}

===========================


While CQRS (Command-Query Responsibility Segregation) does affect data access patterns and can involve the service layer,
 itâ€™s not strictly a data access layer underneath the service layer. Rather, CQRS is a pattern that focuses on separating 
the read and write operations into different models, and it primarily affects how you structure the logic for handling 
commands (writes) and queries (reads).
